### The dynamic range of percevied reality
There seems to be a dynamic range of reality that we not only seem to be comfortable with but also define our framework of thinking. I have a problem with that because it discredits the ideas that we do not percevive or experience in our everyday life. 


### Let's talk about fashion
Recently I posted a couple of my pictures from when I was a kid in facebook. Looking at this my Dad [thinking I may be need more of such pics] sent me a whole bunch of my childhood pictures. It was intersting to look at it, well I say interesting but embarassing would be a more appropriate word. Pants worn almost to my chest with a tacky t-shirt, hair well oiled with evenly powdered face. Though it looked obviously silly to me at this point I was convinced at that time somehow it was a good look.
I'm sure most of my childhood friends would feel the same way when they look at their pictures. This is the nature of fashion, to be ubiquitous and invisible. So many of us fall for this. This is not only true with clothing fashion, but also for moral fashion. 

We beleive in things/not believe in certain things only because that's the omnipresent opinion when otherwise we might think it's obsurd to beleive in such things. We do so because that's the fashion of out times. There seems to be a constant pattern throughout history; in every period, people believed things that were just ridiculous, and beleived them so strongly that you would have gotten in trouble for saying otherwise. We all have insipiration of such personality that did exactly that and gotten in trouble.
