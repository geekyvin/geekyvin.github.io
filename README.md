### The dynamic range of percevied reality
There seems to be a dynamic range of reality that we not only seem to be comfortable with but also define our general framework of thinking. I have a problem with that because it discredits the ideas that we do not perceive or experience in our everyday life. Ideas such as nations can be built by small number of people day after day, brick by brick. It also alienates the idea that great nations cannot fall, because they have always been that way as far as they know. 
This reminds me of the story from the constitutional convention of 1787, when Benjamin Franklin walked out of Pheledelphia's independence hall to find a anxious crowd, there was a women who had the first chance to talk to him. She asked, "well Doctor, what do we have? A Republic or a Monarchy?" and Benjamin Franklin replied "A Republic, if you can keep it."

The sense of fragility of great, big and marvelous things that Ben Franklin had is evident in this statement. But this is the same man who was among the founding fathers who created America from scratch. Soemone who created something from near nothing.

We need to train our mind to capture that sense, that things that are seemingly great can be fragile and fall, we, the quintessential man/women can push something and make it fall, change the history. A sense that we are never too small to be great and never too big to fall. A sense that a handful number of people can build something great, something that could touch millions of people's life.


### Let's talk about fashion
Recently I posted a couple of my pictures from when I was a kid in facebook. Looking at this my Dad [thinking I may be need more of such pics] sent me a whole bunch of my childhood pictures. It was intersting to look at it, well I say interesting but embarassing would be a more appropriate word. Pants worn almost to my chest with a tacky t-shirt, hair well oiled with evenly powdered face. Though it looked obviously silly to me at this point I was convinced at that time somehow it was a good look.
I'm sure most of my childhood friends would feel the same way when they look at their pictures. This is the nature of fashion, to be ubiquitous and invisible. So many of us fall for this. This is not only true with clothing fashion, but also for moral fashion. 

We beleive in things/not believe in certain things only because that's the omnipresent opinion when otherwise we might think it's obsurd to beleive in such things. We do so because that's the fashion of out times. There seems to be a constant pattern throughout history; in every period, people believed things that were just ridiculous, and beleived them so strongly that you would have gotten in trouble for saying otherwise. We all have insipiration of such personality that did exactly that and gotten in trouble.

### Silver Surfer's Prespective
Every one encourages you to grow to a point where you can discount for your own bad mood. But almost nobody encourage you to grow beyond that. Growing beyond that means discounting for society's bad mood.
