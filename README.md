### The dynamic range of percevied reality
There seems to be a dynamic range of reality that we not only seem to be comfortable with but also define our general framework of thinking. I have a problem with that because it discredits the ideas that we do not perceive or experience in our everyday life. Ideas such as nations can be built by small number of people day after day, brick by brick. It also alienates the idea that great nations cannot fall, because they have always been that way as far as they know. 
This reminds me of the story from the constitutional convention of 1787, when Benjamin Franklin walked out of Pheledelphia's independence hall to find a anxious crowd, there was a women who had the first chance to talk to him. She asked, "well Doctor, what do we have? A Republic or a Monarchy?" and Benjamin Franklin replied "A Republic, if you can keep it."

The sense of fragility of great, big and marvelous things that Ben Franklin had is evident in this statement. But this is the same man who was among the founding fathers who created America from scratch. Soemone who created something from near nothing.

We need to train our mind to capture that sense, that things that are seemingly great can be fragile and fall, we, the quintessential man/women can push something and make it fall, change the history. A sense that we are never too small to be great and never too big to fall. A sense that a handful number of people can build something great, something that could touch millions of people's life.


### Let's talk about fashion
Recently I posted a couple of my pictures from when I was a kid in facebook. Looking at this my Dad [thinking I may be need more of such pics] sent me a whole bunch of my childhood pictures. It was intersting to look at it, well I say interesting but embarassing would be a more appropriate word. Pants worn almost to my chest with a tacky t-shirt, hair well oiled with evenly powdered face. Though it looked obviously silly to me at this point I was convinced at that time somehow it was a good look.
I'm sure most of my childhood friends would feel the same way when they look at their pictures. This is the nature of fashion, to be ubiquitous and invisible. So many of us fall for this. This is not only true with clothing fashion, but also for moral fashion. 

We beleive in things/not believe in certain things only because that's the omnipresent opinion when otherwise we might think it's obsurd to beleive in such things. We do so because that's the fashion of out times. There seems to be a constant pattern throughout history; in every period, people believed things that were just ridiculous, and beleived them so strongly that you would have gotten in trouble for saying otherwise. We all have insipiration of such personality that did exactly that and gotten in trouble.

### Silver Surfer's Prespective
Every one encourages you to grow to a point where you can discount for your own bad mood. But almost nobody encourage you to grow beyond that. Growing beyond that means discounting for society's bad mood.

### Possible Responses [A West Point cadet's version] 

Below is a story about Bob McDonald, former CEO and Chairman of Procter & Gamble, and also was the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the Obama Administration. It's a story Bob tells to help the leaders reporting to him to hold themselves accountable for the organizations goals and commit themselves to delivering it, no matter what.
In the fall of 1971, Bob joined the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. Along with the traditional hazing a first-year cadet experiences, Bob learned quickly there were only four acceptable responses when addressed by a superior officer: 

- Yes, Sir
- No, Sir
- I Don't Understand, Sir
- No Excuse, Sir

As Bob explains it, Imagine I've shined my shoes, my trousers are pressed, and I go out to formation. While in line, one of my classmates rushes past and steps in a puddle, splashing mud all over my shoes and trousers. Then an upperclassman walks by and notices. McDonald! Why are you in formation with mud all over your shoes and trousers?

As a West Point cadet, I go through all four possible answers in my head. Yes, sir would just restate the obvious, so that doesn't seem appropriate. And it would probably get me yelled at even more. I couldn't say No, sir because it was clearly true. I'd get thrown out of the academy for lying. I don't understand, sir would just make me look stupid. As a new cadet I was doing enough of that already. The only answer I had left was the fourth one, and it's the most powerful one of all No excuse, sir. Even though something happened to me that was outside my control, I wasn't supposed to make any excuses. I was supposed to say, No excuse, sir. It won't happen again. That's how a West Point cadet takes responsibility, which is an important part of character.

### Possible options in any situation

In his book Originals, Adam Grant talks about the 4 choices people have when handling a dissatisfying situation.

- Neglect
- Voice your opinion
- Persist
- Exit

Exit - Exit means removing yourself from the situation altogether. This could mean quitting your job, ending your marriage or just walking out on a heated argument.

Voice - Voice involves actively trying to improve the situation - voicing your concerns and following it up with necessary actions.

Persist - Persistence is gritting your teeth and bearing the situation. You’ve already accepted that the situation sucks but you’ve decided to go through with it.

Neglect - Neglect entails staying in the current situation but reducing your involvement in it. This could mean just doing just enough at work not to get fired.

Voice
Control vs Commitment

The 4 options can be seen as a trade-off between control (Do you believe you can effect change?) and commitment (Do you care enough to try?).

If you feel you can’t make a difference, then you would choose to persist if you’re committed and you’d neglect if you aren’t. If you feel you can make a difference, then you would choose to voice if you’re committed and you’d quit if you aren’t.
